# Lessons Learned
- SLOW and steady, planning everything out. Slowing myself down was huge so I don't get ahead of myself.

- English first, what am I trying to do. seeing the connections in my head first before touching code.

- Drawing it out first with different colors to see the complex connections I needed to make.

- TEST test test test the code as I go! getting too sucked into coding and then having to track down a million little mistakes. Instead of testing as I go.

- As always brain cells were harmed in the making of this project. Some Ice Cream and cookies did not make it home.
